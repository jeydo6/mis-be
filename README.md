# Medical Information System
This is a set of projects based on .NET. It helps to provide medical services for an abstract medical clinic.

I made this set for my friend Maxim, who has his own medical clinic, and I have plans to add new projects to this set in the future.

### Infomat
Application for self-appointment to a doctor.

It has 2 variants to use:

* Demo - it's a database-free mode, where you have 2 demo-patients: (30000000, 1980) and (31000000, 1980);
* Live - you need the database to use this application in Live mode.
